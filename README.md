# Objective
This project aims to enhance workplace safety by installing a Passive Infrared Sensor (PIR) motion sensor on the safety guard of a machine. If a worker enters the hazardous area, the system will alert the LED to show that the worker is in a dangerous area  to prevent accidents.

# User Stories
1. US1: As a worker, I want the alert to turn on automatically when I enter a dangerous zone so that I can avoid accidents.
3. US2: As a supervisor, I want a visual indicator to show when the machine is stopped so that I can quickly identify the issue.
4. US3: As a safety officer, I want to monitor the machine in case of false trigger, so that I know whether the machine ready or not.

# Features
Core Features
Motion Detection:

The PIR sensor detects motion in the hazardous zone around the machine.

Feature: Real-time monitoring of the hazardous area.

Visual Alert System:

An LED indicator turns on when motion is detected in the hazardous zone.

Feature: Immediate visual feedback for workers and supervisors.

False Trigger Prevention:

The system differentiates between valid motion (e.g., a worker) and false triggers (e.g., small animals or environmental changes).

Feature: Ensures reliability and reduces unnecessary alerts.

Machine Status Indicator:

A visual or audible indicator shows whether the machine is operational or stopped.

Feature: Helps supervisors quickly identify machine status.

Real-Time Monitoring:

The system provides real-time data to safety officers for monitoring and analysis.

Feature: Enables proactive safety management.

Alert Logging:

The system logs all alerts (e.g., motion detected, machine stopped) for future review.

Feature: Helps safety officers analyze incidents and improve safety protocols.
