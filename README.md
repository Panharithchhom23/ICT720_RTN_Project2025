## Topic: Automatic Alert System for Workplace Safety  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b3621ab8-00a4-4f06-bab7-0638c9aaf610)

## Objective
This project aims to enhance workplace safety by installing a Passive Infrared Sensor (PIR) motion sensor on the safety guard of a machine. If a worker enters the hazardous area, the system will alert the LED to show that the worker is in a dangerous area  to prevent accidents.

## Stakeholder
1. Worker
2. Supervisor
3. Safety Officer 
   
## User Stories (US)
- US1: As a worker, I want the alert to turn on automatically when I enter a dangerous zone so that I can avoid accidents.
- US2: As a supervisor, I want a visual indicator to show when the machine is stopped so that I can quickly identify the issue.
- US3: As a safety officer, I want to monitor the machine in case of false trigger, so that I know whether the machine ready or not.

## Features
- Motion Detection: The PIR sensor detects motion in the hazardous zone around the machine.
- Visual Alert System: An LED indicator turns on when motion is detected in the hazardous zone.
- Real-Time Monitoring: The system provides real-time data to safety officers for monitoring and analysis.
