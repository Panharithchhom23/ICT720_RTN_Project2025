## Topic: Automatic Alert System for Workplace Safety  
Workplace safety is a critical concern in industrial environments where heavy machinery poses risks to workers. Ensuring a safe workspace requires proactive measures to detect potential hazards and alert workers before accidents occur. This project introduces an automated safety system that utilizes a Passive Infrared Sensor (PIR) to monitor movement around a machine’s safety guard. By providing real-time visual alerts and monitoring capabilities, the system aims to enhance workplace safety and reduce injury risks.

## Objective
This project aims to enhance workplace safety by integrating a Passive Infrared Sensor (PIR) motion sensor with a machine’s safety guard. If a worker enters the hazardous area, the system will trigger an LED alert, notifying both the worker and safety personnel. This proactive warning system helps prevent accidents by ensuring that workers remain aware of their proximity to dangerous zones. 

## Stakeholder
1. Worker
2. Supervisor
3. Safety Officer 
   
## User Stories (US)
- US1: As a worker, I want the alert to turn on automatically when I enter a dangerous zone so that I can avoid accidents.
- US2: As a supervisor, I want a visual indicator to show when the machine is stopped so that I can quickly identify the issue.
- US3: As a safety officer, I want to monitor the machine in case of false trigger, so that I know whether the machine ready or not.

## Features
- Motion Detection: The PIR sensor detects motion in the hazardous zone around the machine.
- Visual Alert System: An LED indicator turns on when motion is detected in the hazardous zone.
- Real-Time Monitoring: The system provides real-time data to safety officers for monitoring and analysis.
