## Objective
This project aims to enhance workplace safety by installing a Passive Infrared Sensor (PIR) motion sensor on the safety guard of a machine. If a worker enters the hazardous area, the system will alert the LED to show that the worker is in a dangerous area  to prevent accidents.

## User Stories
1. US1: As a worker, I want the alert to turn on automatically when I enter a dangerous zone so that I can avoid accidents.
3. US2: As a supervisor, I want a visual indicator to show when the machine is stopped so that I can quickly identify the issue.
4. US3: As a safety officer, I want to monitor the machine in case of false trigger, so that I know whether the machine ready or not.

## Features
- Motion Detection: The PIR sensor detects motion in the hazardous zone around the machine.
- Visual Alert System: An LED indicator turns on when motion is detected in the hazardous zone.
- Real-Time Monitoring: The system provides real-time data to safety officers for monitoring and analysis.
